# Conclusions
In all cases the correlation is negative. This means the lower the objective function value, the higher the similarity to either the best solution or on average to all other solutions.
We can interpret these results of similarity to best solution as follows: if the solutions obtained by an objectively worse method have better scores, they tend to be closely related in terms of structure to that generated by an objectively better method.
